# Project Proposal

=================
### Dataset
We are using Pitchf/x data, a pitch tracking system that tracks the velocity, movement, release point, spin, and pitch location for every pitch thrown in baseball, allowing pitches and pitchers to be analyzed and compared at a detailed level. 
We will be able to download this dataset using an R package, called "pitchRx", as explained in [the following article](http://cpsievert.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/easily-obtain-mlb-pitchfx-data-using-r/), and save it as a collection of csv files.
